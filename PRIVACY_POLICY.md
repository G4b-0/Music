# Privacy Policy

> *Last Updated: June 20, 2024*

The MissingCore Music app ("Application") is an Open Source service that provides an interface for playing music files stored on your device. You can find the source code of this Application at https://github.com/MissingCore/Music. We do not sell anything, and we do not display ads. Based on [Google's Guidelines on App Data Safety](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/11416267?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid), we state that:

1. **No data is collected** as the data accessed is never sent off your device.
2. **No data is shared** as this is an offline & local first app.

For transparency, here is the data the Application may collect and stores locally on your device, along with its use:

- **App interactions**: Tracking and displaying what you recently played in this Application.
- **Music files**: Required for this Application's functionality.
- **Photos**: Optional â€” used for customizing playlist covers.

## Opt-Out Rights and Data Deletion

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

## Data Security

The security of your personal data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to other websites not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
