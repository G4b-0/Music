# Privacy Policy

> _Last Updated: July 31, 2024_

The MissingCore Music app ("Application") is an Open Source service that provides an interface for playing music files stored on your device. You can find the source code of this Application at https://github.com/MissingCore/Music.

This document is used to inform users regarding the policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use this Application.

**By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.**

## Information Collection and Use

We do not sell anything, and we do not display ads. To improve the experience when using this Application, we utilize Sentry, a third-party service for automatic reporting of any uncaught errors that you may encounter. **Any data sent to Sentry has all Personal Information stripped and is sent using [end-to-end encryption](https://sentry.io/security/#data-flow)**.

You can view the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by this app below:

- [Sentry Security & Compliance](https://sentry.io/security/)
- [Sentry Data Privacy for Mobile](https://docs.sentry.io/security-legal-pii/security/mobile-privacy/)

Based on [Google's Guidelines on App Data Safety](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/11416267?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid), we state that **no data is collected** and **no data is shared**. We do collect some data in the following manner that complies with Google's guidelines.

### Local Data Storage & Collection

For transparency, here is the data the Application may collect and stores locally on your device, along with its use:

- **App interactions**: Tracking and displaying what you recently played in this Application.
- **Music files**: Required for this Application's functionality.
- **Photos**: Optional â€” used for customizing playlist covers.

### Log Data

Whenever you use this Application, in case of an error in the app, we may collect data and information (through third-party services) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device model, operating system version, app version, time and date of use of this Application, and other statistics.

## Opt-Out Rights and Data Deletion

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

As an alternative, you can build this app yourself and remove any code that collects information. You can read the [Personal Privacy Build](https://github.com/MissingCore/Music/blob/main/docs/personal-privacy-build.md) document for instructions on how to do so.

## Data Security

The security of your personal data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to other websites not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
